# STATS220

<h1>This is my repo for STATS220</h1>

<h2>A little about me:</h2>

1. I am undertaking a degree in **Commerce**
2. I am taking *STATS220* because I found STATS10x and STATS20x quite interesting as requirements for my degree, therefore I am taking an extra statistics course (*STATS220*) as an elective
* I am interested in learning about more of the functions in R programming language

* A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university study is ![](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8f/1d/f5/8f1df5fee5225b7293f06b484e430696.jpg)
