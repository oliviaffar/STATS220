# STATS220

This is my repo for STATS220 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in commerce
- I am taking STATS220 because I found STATS10x and STATS20x quite interesting as requirements for my degree, therefore I am taking an extra statistics course (STATS220) as an elective
- I am interested in learning about more of the functions in R programming language

- A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university study is ![]
